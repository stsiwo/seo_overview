## Backlinks

### Why

generally, backlinks are good for SEO since it is a proof that other website trusts you, but it might affect differently base on the type of backlinks. for example, if famouse website has backlink to your web page, it would affect your SEO positively. on the other hands, if bad website put backlink to your web page, it might affect SEO negatively.

#### diversity of Domains / Types

- How diverse the links come from (e.g., a lot of different domains or its type of website)
- higher diverse, higher ranks

#### Relevance

- How relevant the linking page is to the linked page

#### How natural anchor text is

- overly keyword focused anchor text is not good

#### # of links on your page

- higher the number of outgoing links on a page there are, the less value each of those links is worth.

#### the link from bad site hurts you!!

- use this tool if you have a problem of this: here

- if your website is linked from low-quality, spammy website, this isn't a good signal to Google.

## Internal Links

### Why

1. helps SE find the page easily.

## Url

### Why

a minor ranking signal, but the users less likely to click the weird URL (since it is spammy)

### How

1. use clear name path (don't use cryptic/hash name)
2. use logical url structure (subdirectory)
  - don't use date-base URL if your content is sensitive about time
  - remove unnecessary/duplicated name (e.g., /categories/category-car/car1 => /cars/volvo)
  - use only (-) but other special chars like (_), (+), ( )
  - always use lower-case (not Camel-case, Upper-Case)
